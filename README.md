# Experiment_6_Part_1

Part 1: Implementation of Fixed and Growable Stack using Interface_STK The Fixed_STK class implements a fixed-size stack using an array. The Growable_STK class implements a growable stack using an ArrayList. The Interface_STK interface defines methods for stack operations. The StackDemo class demonstrates the usage of both fixed and growable stacks.
Part 1: Implementation of Fixed and Growable Stack using Interface_STK Fixed_STK Class

Implements a fixed-size stack using an array. Provides methods for push, pop, display, overflow, and underflow operations. Growable_STK Class

Implements a growable stack using an ArrayList. Provides methods for push, pop, display, overflow, and underflow operations. Interface_STK Interface

Defines methods for stack operations: push, pop, display, overflow, and underflow. StackDemo Class

Demonstrates the usage of both fixed and growable stacks. Creates instances of Fixed_STK and Growable_STK to perform stack operations
